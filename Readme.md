🛒 SmartShop – Backend

The backend of SmartShop is designed to move beyond a simple local shop system into a smart, geo-aware commerce platform.
It integrates map-based routing, real-time logistics, and intelligent product management for both customers and vendors.

🔑 Backend Features

🏪 Local-to-Smart Transition

Start as a simple local shop backend (products, carts, orders).

Extend with smart modules: vendor clustering, delivery optimization, live tracking.

📦 Order & Inventory Management

Real-time stock updates.

Multi-vendor product management.

🗺️ Map Routing & Delivery

Integration with Google Maps API / OpenStreetMap.

Smart route optimization (shortest path, multiple deliveries).

Estimated Delivery Time (EDT) calculation.

🔐 Authentication & Roles

Customer, Vendor, Delivery Agent, Admin.

JWT-based token security.

📊 Analytics & Reporting

Sales insights, customer behavior, delivery efficiency.

🏗️ Backend Tech Stack

Framework: Node.js (Express) / FastAPI

Database: PostgreSQL + PostGIS (geo-queries) or MongoDB with GeoJSON

Maps & Routing: Google Maps API / OpenStreetMap + OSRM

Authentication: JWT (role-based access control)

Queue System (optional): Redis / RabbitMQ for delivery task assignment

Deployment: Docker + Nginx + AWS/GCP

🛠️ Example Routing Flow

Customer places an order.

System checks nearest vendor & delivery agent using geo-coordinates.

Map routing API finds the optimal path.

Delivery agent gets assigned + live tracking enabled.

ETA shared with the customer in real-time.
